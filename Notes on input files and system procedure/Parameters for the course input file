This file follows a clear structure:

 n = the total # of courses offered by the University

 	/*
 		 * What follows is n entries, one per course offered
 		 * core coursees are signified as c# - Students need to take all of these to graduate
 		 * and electives as e# - Students need to take at least 2 to graduate
 		 * '#' is a number of equal length for every course (I'd say be prepared to read 4 numbers after the letter)
 		 * Each course might have some pre-requisite courses
 		 * These are formatted the following way:

 		 	c1			- Core Course 1 has no pre-requisites
 		 	c2 e1		- Core Course 2 has 1 pre-requisite: e1 
 		 	c3 c2 c1	- Core Course 3 has 2 pre-requisites: c2 and c1
 		 	e1 c1 		- Elective Course 1 has 1 pre-requisite: c1 
 	*/

So, as an example file:

10				- 10 total courses offered
c1				- c1, no pre-req
e1				- e1, no pre-req
c2				- c2, no pre-req
c3 c2 e1		- c3,  2 pre-req: c2 & e1
c4 c3 c1		- c4,  2 pre-req: c3 & c1, 
e2 c1			- e2,  1 pre-req: c1
e3				- e3, no pre-req
e5 e3 c2 c1 e1	- e5:  4 pre-req: e3 c2 c1 e1
c5 c2 c1		- c5:  2 pre-req: c2 c1
e6 c5 c4 e5		- e6:  3 pre-req: c5 c4 e5
c6 e6			- c6:  1 pre-req: e6

We need a data structure for these that looks as follows: 

Data Structure name: Course
Data contained:				+ Course ID
							+ Vector of Pre-req course IDs
