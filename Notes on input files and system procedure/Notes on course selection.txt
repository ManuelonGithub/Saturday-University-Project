The basis for the course selection is the following (simplest way to do it - no optimization considered here):

Step 1: For a course in the total course pool, check if student already completed them, if so move to next course.

Step 2: Check if course has already been assigned a time for the term, if yes then move on (so students don't take the same class twice)

Step 3: Check if student has all the pre-req needed for this course 
	1. if yes, add to the course selection pool and move to next course.
	2. if no, simply just move to next course without adding current into the pool.

Iterate steps 1 and 2 until we reach the end of all courses offered by the University. then,

Step 4: figure out how many items in our course selection pool. (let's say this is n)

Step 5: Pick a random # between 1 and n or 0 and n-1 or 0 and n (depends on how we got n)

Step 6: Assign the selected course in the vector as the "best course for the student"
